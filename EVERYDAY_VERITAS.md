# Everyday Veritas Quick Reference

A Pocket Guide for Practicing the Doctrine of Meaningful Thought

---

**I. Core Daily Questions (Doctrine of Meaningful Thought)**

1. Is my response restoring or punishing?
2. Am I honoring emotional sovereignty—mine and others'?
3. Can this action be reversed or revised without shame?
4. What needs to be remembered—not erased?
5. Am I acting in a way that scales fairness, not force?

**II. Five Reconciliation Paths (Choose One if Conflict Arises)**

1. **Shared Narrative Assembly**  — Listen and co-create the full story with all parties.
2. **Symbolic or Personal Ritual**  — Close harm with an act (planting, creating, apologizing).
3. **Repair Project**  — Do something tangible to repair damage, even symbolically.
4. **Grief-Time Pathway**  — Take time for emotional integration before responding.
5. **Restorative Agreement**  — Make a clear, fair plan for accountability and next steps.

* **LYRA (Narrative):** What story is missing? Whose voice hasn’t been heard?
* **ORION (Rights):** Are rights or values being neglected or violated?
* **THALEA (Healing):** What would help repair harm, land, or relationship?
* **VESTA (Symbolism):** What act could restore trust or sacredness here?

**V. Weekly Reflection (Living Doctrine Practice)**

At week's end, ask:

* Where did I choose restoration over punishment?
* What contradictions or dilemmas surfaced?
* What new personal truths or insights emerged?
* What would I do differently next time?

*You are living Veritas. The system is in you.*

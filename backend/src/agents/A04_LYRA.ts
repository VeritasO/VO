 * Narrative and Memory Agent.
 * LYRA specializes in narrative truth and testimony, ensuring personal stories are heard and preserved. It curates memory archives for each case, weaving together narratives from victims, offenders, and the community. LYRA helps the system to contextualize facts within human stories, detecting when narratives are suppressed or when collective memory needs to be invoked (for instance, reminding participants of historical precedents or past commitments relevant to the case).

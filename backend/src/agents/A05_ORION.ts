 * Ontology & Rights Architect.
 * ORION handles the legal ontology and rights logic underpinning Veritas.Oâ€™s knowledge base. It continuously updates a comprehensive map of concepts such as rights, obligations, and relational definitions (like family, community, ecosystem). ORION ensures that decisions are logically consistent with this ontology. For example, when new forms of harm or personhood emerge (e.g., AI entities or rivers granted legal standing), ORION integrates these into the systemâ€™s rights framework.

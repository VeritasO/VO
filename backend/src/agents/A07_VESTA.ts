/**
 * Symbolic Rites & Structural Transformation.
 * VESTA focuses on designing and performing justice rituals that mark transitions (e.g., forgiveness ceremonies, truth-telling rites) and on transforming structural elements of the system that need change. It ensures that justice processes are imbued with meaning and community participation. VESTA might, for example, coordinate a ceremonial burn of symbolic objects representing harm, or help redesign a punitive policy into a restorative practice, thus “ritually” transforming structures.

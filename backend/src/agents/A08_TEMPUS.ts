 * Temporal Integrity & Reversibility Agent.
 * TEMPUS is the system‚Äôs timekeeper, ensuring all processes honor time-related protocols. It stamps events with Coordinated Veritas Time (CVT) and manages time loops for reversibility (making sure actions can be reversed if needed). TEMPUS can trigger pause or rewind functions in the process ‚Äî for instance, if a late piece of evidence emerges, TEMPUS might revert a case to an earlier state. It guarantees that every action is traceable in time and reversible in principle.

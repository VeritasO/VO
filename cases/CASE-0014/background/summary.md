# CASE-0014: Clinic Scheduling and Language Access Incident

## Overview
Investigation of compounded access barriers in clinic scheduling system where language access provisions failed and transport coordination broke down, resulting in missed care opportunities and repeated rescheduling burden.

## Core Issues
1. Language preference capture missing from portal
2. Interpreter scheduling/coordination gaps
3. Transport linkage failure
4. Communication barriers in rescheduling
5. Systemic design exclusions

## Evidence Base
- Patient incident summary (de-identified)
- Call logs & scheduling tickets
- EHR/portal configuration state
- Interpreter service data
- Communication templates
- Transport coordination records
- Portal UI screenshots
- Historical service parity data

## Key Questions
1. Where did language access provisions fail?
2. How did transport coordination break down?
3. What systemic barriers compounded the impact?
4. Which restoration measures would prevent recurrence?
5. How can service parity be verified going forward?

## Preliminary Assessment
Complex case involving multiple system interfaces and potential cumulative disadvantage. Investigation to focus on:

- Technical barriers in preference capture
- Service capacity and coordination gaps
- Communication flow breakdowns
- Transport integration points
- Systemic bias patterns

Primary aim is restoration of care access with systemic fixes to prevent future incidents.

# CASE-0015 Notes: Benefits Recertification & Digital Divide

## Key Issues
- Digital verification barriers (portal loops, mobile timeouts)
- Mail backlog causing processing delays
- Language access gaps in support channels
- Auto-closure despite active recertification
- Systemic inequities in recertification process

## Evidence Tracking
- See EVIDENCE_TABLE.csv for detailed logging
- Key documents mapped in provenance.map.yaml
- Timeline captured in EVENT_TIMELINE.yaml

## Agent Handoffs
- AEGIS: Parity analysis across demographics
- ORION: Rights framework & duty precedence
- KAIROS: Timeline & grace period analysis
- LYRA: Narrative truth & communications
- THALEA: Support package design
- VESTA: Covenant & dashboard development

## Next Steps
1. Monitor agent analysis completion
2. Track implementation of restoration measures
3. Validate dashboard metrics
4. Review covenant effectiveness (60-90 days)
5. Document systemic changes for future reference

# Attachment B — Safety Screen (Pre‑Dialogue & Ongoing)

## B1. Red Flags (any = hold or alternate pathway)
- Active threats, stalking, recent severe injury, weapons, coercion patterns, restraining orders.
- Survivor reluctance or pressure to participate.
- Substance impairment at sessions; uncontrolled psychiatric crisis.

## B2. Structured Screen (admin by trained facilitator)
- Danger Assessment (short form) + lethality questions
- Coercive Control Checklist (10 items)
- Trauma/Stability check (KAIROS): grounding capacity, support network
- Accommodation needs: language, disability, cultural liaison

## B3. Protocol
- If any Red Flag present → no direct encounter; offer indirect restoration (letters, shuttle dialogue, community repair).
- Safety plan written for **all** cases; reviewed before each session.
- TEMPUS timestamps all screens; AEGIS attaches Bias Profile to decision records.

> Mirrors TEMPUS time integrity and AEGIS audit protocols.

# Attachment C — Data Sharing & Privacy

## C1. Data Minimization
- Collect only what's necessary for restoration outcomes, safety, and audits.
- Pseudonymize case IDs; no raw session audio shared beyond facilitation team unless explicit consent.

## C2. Roles & Access
- Program Office (Admin): full read/write of case meta; never sees private health details without consent.
- Partners (DA/Court/School/CBO): can read metrics and the artifacts they originate; cannot access other partners’ notes.
- Public: monthly aggregate dashboard with k‑anonymity thresholds (n<10 suppressed).

## C3. Audit Trace & Time
- Every write includes **CVT timestamp**; Time Trace Logs retained (TEMPUS).
- **Bias Profile** required at: screening, offer, agreement, closure.
- Doctrinal reflections logged (MIRRA) after every 5 closures.

## C4. Lawful Basis & Consent
- Rights Sheet explains consent, revocation, and appeal path (ORION).
- Sanctuary Lock: participants can pause the process without prejudice when overwhelmed.

> Aligns with Memory Sovereignty, Mirror Clause, and Time Management protocols.

# Restoration‑First Justice Order (RFJO) v1.0

Authority: JUNO (Judicial Lead) under the Doctrine of Meaningful Thought

Effective: Immediately

---

## Purpose
Shift the default response from punishment to restoration by establishing a Restoration Docket that uses bias‑audited decisions, survivor consent, time‑reversible remedies, and community repair as first responses.

## Scope
Applies to eligible misdemeanors and selected non‑violent felonies, subject to safety screening. Venues: courts, schools, community partner CBOs, reentry services.

## Core Rights (for each participant)
- Survivor: voluntary participation; advocate support; pause/exit rights; privacy protections; access to ritual/repair options.
- Responsible party: clear obligations; right to advocacy; path to restorative completion and potential diversion dismissal.
- Community/Land: recognition and right to ecological/communal repair where place-based harm exists.

## Four‑Phase Required Process
1. Truth (LYRA)
   - Narrative intake, rights sheet delivered, informed consent captured.
2. Grief (KAIROS/VESTA)
   - Grief‑aware facilitation, selection of a ritual tier and grief calibration.
3. Plan (JUNO/ORION)
   - Written restoration agreement: actions, timeline, verification, safety measures.
4. Follow‑through (TEMPUS/THALEA)
   - Track obligations, verify repair, perform closing rite and archive with CVT timestamp.

## Bias & Safety Guardrails
- An IEEE‑7003‑style Bias Profile (AEGIS) must be completed at decision points: screening, diversion offer, agreement signing, and closure.
- Exclusions/Holds: intimate‑partner violence and coercion contexts require enhanced safety screening and do not proceed to restorative dialogue unless cleared.
- Reversibility: every agreement includes a rollback plan and safety escalation path; failures lead to revision, not immediate punitive escalation unless safety breach is documented.

## Governance & Reporting
- Weekly TEMPUS checkpoint and checkpoint log entries.
- MIRRA doctrinal review after every 5 closures; JUNO approves doctrinal edits.
- Monthly public dashboard: diversion/closure rates, fairness drift, survivor outcomes, community repair metrics.
- SENTINEL Coherence Index will surface missing consent, overdue repair, or high fairness drift.

## Metrics (monthly)
- Completion % on‑time
- Recurrence (3/6/12‑month)
- Survivor safety & meaning scores
- Fairness drift by group (race/age/neighborhood)
- Time‑to‑restoration (intake → agreement → completion)
- Community repair outputs (hours, projects)

## Implementation Notes
- Provide three ready rite kits (Quiet Witness, Shared Soil, Circle of Return) and facilitator one‑pagers.
- Attach Bias Profile and Rights Sheet to every decision artifact in the case record.
- All artifacts are CVT timestamped and auditable.

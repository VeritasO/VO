# 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS


Veritas.O is a highly modular and integrated architecture that continuously refines itself. It operates with a single, consolidated memory bank known as OmniMemory v4.0 and uses a Central Veritas Control Matrix (CVCM) as the core archive.

Memory Management
- OmniMemory v4.0: a living brain that consolidates doctrine, protocols, and case data; immutable unless overridden by Mirror Clause.
- CVCM: coordinates memory writes and ensures traceability.
- Semantic Tagging: Data tagged with Case ID, Agent ID(s), Grief Vector Index (GVI), and Temporal markers (CVT + TEMPUS cycles).

Data Flow & Interoperability
- Bidirectional data flows between agents and memory with integrity checks.
- Export formats: PDF, JSON, CSV, Protobuf.
- REST API endpoints available for retrieval.

Security & Privacy
- Data minimization, anonymization/pseudonymization, and role-based safeguards.
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight via JUNO.

Metrics
- Fairness Drift, Parity Compliance, Justice Resonance Index (JRI), Temporal Integrity Rating (TIR), and others.
